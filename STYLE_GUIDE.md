# Brand Voice Style Guide

## Tone & Voice

Our brand voice is **friendly, clear, and helpful**. We speak to users like a knowledgeable friend, not a robot or a corporate entity.

### Do's
- Use simple, everyday language
- Be concise and get to the point
- Use active voice
- Address the user directly ("you" not "the user")
- Be encouraging and positive

### Don'ts
- Don't use technical jargon unless necessary
- Don't be condescending or overly formal
- Don't use passive voice
- Don't write overly long sentences (keep under 20 words when possible)
- Don't use ALL CAPS except for acronyms

## Error Messages

Error messages should:
1. Explain what went wrong in plain language
2. Suggest how to fix it
3. Be empathetic, not blaming

**Good:** "We couldn't save your changes. Check your internet connection and try again."

**Bad:** "ERROR: Save operation failed due to network timeout exception."

## Button Labels

- Use action verbs: "Save", "Continue", "Get Started"
- Keep to 1-3 words when possible
- Be specific: "Save Changes" not just "Submit"

## Placeholder Text

- Be helpful and specific
- Show the expected format when relevant
- Example: "Enter your email (e.g., name@example.com)"
